# Disney Wait Times Notifier

A microservice that sends wait time alerts for your favorite rides.  

SMS alerts are sent when specified rides fall below a set threshold so you can react faster than any other guest when a temporary dip in wait time occurs.  That 15 minute wait won't last long for Space Montain!.
